# Delivery System

This project is a delivery system for fast food restaurants at **Brazil**.

When acessing a unique restaurant link, clients are able to insert their addresses, search for their preferred food, ask for the delivery, wait until it arrives and then pay at the moment they receive their food.

That means, online payments are not supported.

### Architecture

This project is based upon **microsservices architecture**.

### BDD

This project's requirements are structured over **Behavior Driven Development**, following the template of **2007 Dan North**.
